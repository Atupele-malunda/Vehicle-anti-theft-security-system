# ABSTRACT

In today's modern society, the alarming rise in cases involving the theft of vehicles has become a cause for concern. 
However, advancements in technology have paved the way for innovative solutions to combat this issue. One such system aims to effectively mitigate car theft
by employing cutting-edge techniques, including the detection of stolen vehicle number plates and facial recognition of individuals in proximity to or inside the car. 
By integrating these mechanisms, the system offers a comprehensive approach to enhancing security and preventing unauthorized use of vehicles. Once the number plate information is extracted,
it is compared against a comprehensive database containing records of vehicles. This comparison helps determine whether the vehicle in question is the one reported as stolen. Additionally,
the system incorporates facial recognition technology to identify individuals near or inside the vehicle. Facial features and unique identifiers are analyzed to ascertain the presence of authorized personnel.
The integration of number plate detection and facial recognition provides a comprehensive approach to enhancing security measures against vehicle theft.
The system's ability to accurately detect stolen number plates and identify unauthorized individuals helps prevent unauthorized use of vehicles.
By promptly alerting authorities or owners when potential threats are detected, the system plays a crucial role in mitigating car theft incidents.
Overall, this innovative system employs advanced algorithms and a comprehensive database to effectively detect stolen vehicles and unauthorized access.
By leveraging technology, it offers an efficient and reliable solution to combat the growing issue of vehicle theft, thereby providing a safer environment for vehicle owners and society as a whole.
